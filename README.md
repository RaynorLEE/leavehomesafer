# CLeave Home Safe

The application is a compatible implementation for users to scan QR codes from LeaveHomeSafe (安心出行).  According to the regulations in Hong Kong, all restaurants are forced to require customers to scan LeaveHomeSafe QR Codes.  However, there are no restrictions on the application used to scan such QR code. (See: [egn20212543106][egn20212543106])  _Nevertheless, the above mentioned are not the reasons or incentives for this application.  I develop this one solely for practicing my JavaScript programming techniques and to demonstrate my technical strength.  You should never use this application for any illegal purpose.  If being questioned, the users take the responsibilities to explain the situation and follow the local laws.  The author takes no responsibility for any usage of this application._

This application understand the information in LeaveHomeSafe QR Codes.  Using this compatible implementation, you need to manually save your records by clicking buttons.  If you don't click, no saving will be done (due to technical limitations).  The data will only saved on your browser in your phone.

The name of the application is not fixed, and the current name CLeaveHomeSafe stands for 'Compatible with LeaveHomeSafe'.  Do not confused with the Hong Kong government's application LeaveHomeSafe.


## How to use? 

- Click on 'Enter' to enter
- Scan the QR Code
- Check the location. If that's not correct, you can edit it. 
- Press the tick to save the record. _Due to technical limitations_, the record-saving mechanism is not automatic.  Then press 'Leave' when you leave the place.
